              <h2>Gregor Townsend feels Scotland delivered their best performance of the Championship in their narrow
                32-21 defeat against France.
              </h2>
              <p>Having beaten England and Wales in the opening two rounds, Scotland travelled to Stade de France hoping
                to take another step towards a first Grand Slam since 1999.
              </p>
              <p>Grant Gilchrist‚Äôs early red card put them on the back foot and though France‚Äôs Mohamed Haouas was also
                dismissed early on, Les Bleus raced into a 19-0 lead with just 18 minutes played.

                Scotland fought back courageously and trailed by just four points as the clock entered the red but Gael
                Fickou‚Äôs overtime try robbed them of a bonus point, the least they deserved for their part in an epic
                encounter.
              </p>
              <p>‚ÄúI was very proud of the team because we probably produced our best rugby of the tournament and didn‚Äôt
                win,‚Äù said Townsend.
              </p>
              <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird saying that when you‚Äôve had two victories but a lot of our play was outstanding. There was
                effort, high skill and then there was resilience to go a man and points down and come back into the
                game.
              </p>
              <p>‚ÄúBut really, we are disappointed. We were over the line on two occasions and didn‚Äôt score.‚Äù</p>
              <p>Townsend‚Äôs side were hampered by the early dismissal of Gilchrist, who was shown a red card by referee
                Nika Amashukeli after just six minutes for a shoulder-to-head collision with Anthony Jelonch.</p>
              </p>
              <p>That forced them into a reshuffle, with the returning Hamish Watson sacrificed for Jonny Gray to
                mitigate a potential disadvantage at the set-piece.

              <p>If anything, the greater space across the park played into the hands of Finn Russell and Huw Jones, who
                dovetailed brilliantly.</p>
              <p> Neither started Scotland‚Äôs first two Autumn Nations Series fixtures but both are now considered a key
                part of Townsend‚Äôs attack, and were responsible for all three of Scotland‚Äôs tries in Paris.
