          <p>The Italy national rugby union team (Italian: Squadra nazionale italiana di rugby) represents Italy in
            men's international rugby union. The team is known as gli Azzurri (the light-blues). Savoy blue is the
            common colour of the national teams representing Italy, as it is the traditional colour of the royal
            House of Savoy which reigned over the Kingdom of Italy from 1860 to 1946.</p>

          <p>Italy has played international rugby since 1929, and for decades was considered one of the best
            European teams outside the Five Nations Championship. Since 2000, Italy has competed annually in the Six
            Nations Championship with England, France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In 2013, they were holders of
            the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy which is played annually between Italy and France. Italy is ranked 12th in
            the world by the IRB as of 13th February 2023.</p>

          <p>Italian rugby rose to prominence in 2000 when it was added to the Five Nations, creating the Six
            Nations. Initially on the receiving end of some heavy defeats, the side grew in competitiveness,
            recording a fourth-place finish in 2007 and 2013, and one-sided defeats became less frequent. The
            Azzurri showed respectable results when playing at home in the early 2010s: they defeated France 22–21
            in the 2011 Six Nations; and during the 2013 Six Nations, they again beat France 23–18,[1] also
            defeating Ireland 22–15.[2] Until 19 March 2022, Italy had not won a Six Nations game since beating
            Scotland in 2015. However, on 19 March, Edoardo Padovani scored a last minute try against Wales, to earn
            Italy their first win in 36 games, as well as their first away win against Wales and third away win in
            the tournament.
          </p>

          <p>Italy has competed at every Rugby World Cup since the first tournament in 1987, where Italy played the
            inaugural game against New Zealand, but is yet to progress beyond the first round. The team has
            developed a reputation for being a consistent middle player at the tournament. Italy's results since the
            inception of a new group stage formula in 2003 have consistently followed a pattern of two wins against
            Tier 2 teams and two losses against Tier 1 ones (although in 2019, the match against New Zealand was
            cancelled due to Hagibis typhoon). The current head coach is Kieran Crowley, and the captain is
            currently Michele Lamaro.
